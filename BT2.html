        <p><i><span>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music <br> and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties."</span></i></p>
        <p><i><span>Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar," "Love Story," and "You Belong with<br> Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-establishing her image from country to pop with the synth-pop<br> set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-infused Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",<br> "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," "Bad Blood," and "Look What You Made Me Do".</span></i></p>
